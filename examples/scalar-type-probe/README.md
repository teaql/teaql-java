# Generated canonical naming / SQLite probe

Run `node examples/scalar-type-probe/verify-local.cjs` from this runtime checkout.
The example always compiles repository-local runtime modules. It never installs
TeaQL into a shared Maven repository or edits the frozen generated library.
Set `TEAQL_JAVA_SCALAR_EVIDENCE_DIR` to a new absolute evidence directory to keep
the two logs and SQLite database at a chosen location. Repeated rounds use the
same database without cleanup; disposable builds are removed on exit.

The evaluated two-object model tests native Q/E/updaters, canonical Ledger,
Checker/policy/audit keys, physical columns, Value/Null/NotLoaded, twelve malformed
namespace rejections, two required-field rejections, default typed JSON, and a
real second-UPDATE failure after the first UPDATE executes. The same object graph
is retried after rollback, preserving versions and producing two committed audits.
Raw generic mutations are used only for the explicitly labelled negative tests.

This does not yet qualify all JSON naming profiles, cross-runtime schema parity,
or a published artifact. Source-fixture provenance is in `fixture-manifest.json`.
